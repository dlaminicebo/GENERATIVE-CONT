## ðŸ¤– Agent AI: Empowering Autonomy with Generative Intelligence

Agent AI refers to autonomous systems that use generative AI models to reason, make decisions, and interact with users or other systems.  
These agents are powered by large language models that generate natural language, write code, and simulate conversation.  
By integrating memory, logic, and adaptive behavior, Agent AIs can automate workflows and perform complex tasks with minimal human input.

This blend of reasoning and generative capabilities allows Agent AIs to function in dynamic environments, making them powerful tools across industries.
